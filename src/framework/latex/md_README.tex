Test Skeleton of (potential) Jet\+Scape Framework

With cmake\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
\end{DoxyCode}


the test binaries will be generated in the build folder To run the tests, you need to stay at the framework directory and type \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
./build/brickTest
\end{DoxyCode}


This \char`\"{}simulates\char`\"{} our brick test. The temperature from the brick is available in the jet energy loss modules. The jet energyloss module consists of two \char`\"{}test\char`\"{} modules, Matter performing a random in time democratic split and Martini is doing nothing. Furthermore in \char`\"{}\+Matter\char`\"{} I added random \char`\"{}new graph roots\char`\"{} for testing (simulating scattering with medium partons). The switching criteria is arbitrarily set to 5\+GeV in pt for testing. An ascii output file is created which you can read in with the provided reader\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
./build/readerTest
\end{DoxyCode}


which reads in the generated showers does some D\+FS search and shows the output. You can generate an output graph format which can be easily visualized using graph\+Viz or other tools like Gephi (G\+UI for free for Mac) or more adanvanced, graph-\/tools (Python) and many more. Furthermore, as a \char`\"{}closure\char`\"{} test, I used the Fast\+Jet core packackage (compiled in our Jet\+Scape library) to perform a simple jetfinding (on the \char`\"{}final\char`\"{} partons, in graph language, incoming partons in a vertex with no outgoing partons/childs), and since the \char`\"{}shower\char`\"{} is perfectly collinear the jet pT is identical to the hard process parton pT (modulo some random new partons/roots in the final state, see above).


\begin{DoxyCode}
./build/hydroFromFileTest
\end{DoxyCode}


This \char`\"{}simulates\char`\"{} a test by reading in hydrodynamic evolution from an external file. The temperature and flow velocity at any given space-\/time poisition is available in the jet energy loss modules. The jet energyloss module is the same as the one in the brick\+Test. The hydro file reader is from a 3rd-\/party program. Part of the code requires the H\+D\+F5 library.


\begin{DoxyCode}
./build/MUSICTest
\end{DoxyCode}


This \char`\"{}simulates\char`\"{} a test with M\+U\+S\+IC (a viscous hydrodynamic code). The temperature and flow velocity at any given space-\/time position is available in the jet energy loss modules. The jet energyloss module is the same as the one in the brick\+Test. M\+U\+S\+IC is treated as a 3rd party program outside the J\+E\+T\+S\+C\+A\+PE framework. It requires M\+PI and G\+SL libraries installed in the computer.

If cmake found other libraries Hep\+MC, R\+O\+OT or Pythia8, you might have to add the library path\textquotesingle{}s in the setup.\+csh script. For sure works on Mac Os X 10.\+11.\+6.

To make a class documentation using doxygen\+:

doxygen Jet\+Scape\+Doxy.\+conf

Getting started on a Mac\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install Xcode and command-\/line tools
\end{DoxyItemize}

For further packages needed (like C\+Make, Pythia, R\+O\+OT, Graph\+Viz) I recommend homebrew for Mac\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install homebrew (after you install Xcode)
\end{DoxyItemize}

/usr/bin/ruby -\/e \char`\"{}\$(curl -\/fs\+S\+L https\+://raw.\+githubusercontent.\+com/\+Homebrew/install/master/install)\char`\"{}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install C\+Make via homebrew type\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}

brew install cmake


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install doxygen\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}

brew install doxygen


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tap some repos for further sceintific packages\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}

brew tap davidchall/hep

brew tap homebrew/science


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install Pythia8 for example\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}

brew install pythia8


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install graph\+Viz\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}

brew install graphviz --with-\/app --with-\/bindings


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install root6
\end{DoxyItemize}

brew install root6


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install graph-\/tool (python). If done you can create a colored and \char`\"{}fancy\char`\"{} graph with the provided python script.
\end{DoxyItemize}

brew install graph-\/tool


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install hdf5

```bash brew tap homebrew/science brew install hdf5 --enable-\/cxx ```
\item Install Open\+M\+PI

```bash brew install open-\/mpi ```
\item Install G\+SL

```bash brew install gsl ```
\end{DoxyItemize}

(and most of other packackes we need)

Remark\+: So far on brew Hep\+MC is only available in version 2, version 3 is required for the current code, nicer wirter interfaces to root for example. So one has to install it from\+: \href{http://hepmc.web.cern.ch/hepmc/}{\tt http\+://hepmc.\+web.\+cern.\+ch/hepmc/}

\subsection*{M\+U\+S\+IC support}

M\+U\+S\+IC is a (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamical code developed at Mc\+Gill university. (Official website\+: \href{http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/MUSIC}{\tt http\+://www.\+physics.\+mcgill.\+ca/\+M\+U\+S\+IC}) M\+U\+S\+IC can be integrated into the J\+E\+T\+S\+C\+A\+PE framework. To download the lastest version of M\+U\+S\+IC, one can run the shell script under the 3rdparty folder,


\begin{DoxyCode}
./get\_music.sh
\end{DoxyCode}


This shell script will clone the latest version of M\+U\+S\+IC to 3rdparty folder. It also setup the enviroment variables for M\+U\+S\+IC to run. Specifically, M\+U\+S\+IC needs the folder path for the E\+OS tables. Please make sure the enviroment variable H\+Y\+D\+R\+O\+P\+R\+O\+G\+R\+A\+M\+P\+A\+TH to be set to the path for M\+U\+S\+IC code package.

When compiling M\+U\+S\+IC with J\+E\+T\+S\+C\+A\+PE, please turn on the M\+U\+S\+IC support option when generating the cmake configuration file,


\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -Dmusic=ON ..
make
\end{DoxyCode}


To run J\+E\+T\+S\+C\+A\+PE with M\+U\+S\+IC, one needs to use M\+PI commands,


\begin{DoxyCode}
mpirun -np 1 ./MUSICTest
\end{DoxyCode}
